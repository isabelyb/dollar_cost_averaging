Controlling emotions and Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) applied in criptocurrency ADA, ETH and BTC


Dollar-cost averaging **(DCA)** is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices. Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan.

**Controlling emotions** for investing is a skill absolutely necesary to avoid bad decisions. According with great investors, one of the best strategy is to set one day a week to invest, not depending on the ups and downs of the market. If combine this strategy with DCA is posible to gain control about our investing. The succes of our inversions is another story and depending on a lot of variables.
